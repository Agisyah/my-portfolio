Hello World!

This is my first project of making a website and I'm still trying to learn. Hope you enjoy (or may not enjoy) my spaghetti code T_T

Feel free to give any constructive criticism if you somehow saw my unknown project out of nowhere.

Logbook:\
**December 16th 2025**\
"my-portfolio" was first created and uploaded to GitHub

**December 20th 2025**\
Updated version control semantics into "Version alpha-(major update).(minor update).(bug patches)"\
(e.g. Version alpha-1.1.1)

**December 21st 2025**
1. Updated version control semantics into "v(major update).(minor update).(bug patches)"
(e.g. v1.1.1)
2. Changed and restarted the semantic versioning to "v1.0.0" following GitHub's release notes feature that I just found out how to use lol

**December 26th 2025**\
Decided to change most of my websites into component-based and it created major changes to the CSS structure and others.\

P.S. I might move this kinds of stuff into an actual blog, after I know when to make time to make my own blog or something. I don't think I should treat my README.md like this -_-
